The Marketing Automation system has enabled marketers to become**active contributors to the sales process**as now they are able to capture the moment when a prospect's interest is aroused (e.g. via identifying and tracking prospects during their visit to a website) and then to lead the prospects through automated and personalized processes to the moment when they are ready to purchase or contact your sales department.  
**In practical terms, by using Marketing Automation you will be able to:**

* ensure effective cooperation between marketing and sales teams by:
*   * preparing prospects to make a purchase - Lead Nurturing
  * notifying the sales team of new prospects who are ready to purchase
  * educating prospects already involved in the sales process
* build the company's value through acquisition of knowledge in marketing processes:
*   * development of educational processes based on e-mail marketing
  * development of processes by means of dynamic web content
  * development of automated sales processes - Lead Routing
* analyze ROI and efficiency of marketing operations covering:
*   * Efficiency of particular marketing processes and actions
  * Efficiency of the Marketing Mix in the sales process
  * ROI on marketing operations

The role of marketer and the marketing team is also undergoing dramatic changes as they tend to give up their traditional duties connected with marketing production and building brands using Adwords, SEO etc (these being increasingly outsourced these days) and start to concentrate on working out long-term marketing processes and acquisition of marketing knowledge.
