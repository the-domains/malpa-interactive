It is more than a hundred years since John Wanamaker uttered the famous words:**â€žHalf the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The troub****le is I do not know which half".** An IBM CMO study carried out last year among marketing directors reveals that not much has changed since that then:

* **63%** of Marketing Directors expect that ROI will become a key indicator measuring their performance within the period of the next 3- 5 years, while only **44%**are prepared for it
* **73%** of marketing departments have not developed any strategy for converting leads and prospective clients to payers
* **61%** of marketing staff pass all leads, including the weakest ones, directly to sale while not more than**27%**of all leads will normally qualify
* **95%** of company owners and presidents, if faced with the need to cut fixed costs will cut marketing budgets in the first place.

From a shareholder's perspective, marketing does not contribute to the company's value as the marketing operations are regarded as a 'nice-to-have' rather than "need-to-have' from the strategic point of view. Ineffective marketing normally has its sources in ineffective tools and techniques marketing teams use: unstable SEO, disappointing effects of Adwords campaigns, limited control over social media expenses, to name just a few.  
**As a result, a 2012 study carried out by Adobe has included marketers on the list of least valuable professions to society, next to dancers and actors. Interestingly, the study reveals that even marketers themselves do not speak very highly of their own profession.**
