In the meantime, we can witness a drastic change in sales models - the phenomenon directly connected with an increasing penetration of the Internet gaining more ground in consumer behaviour. The study shows that:

* Buyers would like to control as much as 70 % of the buying process
* 90 % of all consumers do online research prior to buying

Conclusions? To begin with, the best selling strategy could be best described as**DO NOT SELL**; secondly, we can observe**a gap in the sales process**as when the buyer contacts you in order to buy your products or services, the decision to purchase has already been taken. The gap in the sales process as well as the way this gap is addressed by the Marketing Automation system have been illustrated below.
